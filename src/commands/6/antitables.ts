Disable all autobuyers and sacrifice again to reset your dimensions. Then, toggle Until 10 next to tickspeed and buy 1 of each dim. Then toggle Buy 1 back, and buy 10 2nd dims. Continue up from 3rd to 8th dim, buying just enough dimensions to get the Dimension Multiplier (the number below the dimension name) higher than the last. If you complete the challenge too quickly to get the multipliers in ascending order, you can do it in a normal infinity.`,

Continue up from 3rd to 8th dim, buying just enough dimensions to get the Dimension Multiplier (the number below the dimension name) higher than the last. 
  If your 1st dimension multiplier raises too quickly, you may be unable to complete the achievement until you reach 1.8e308 IP. If this is the case, don't worry, you don't need it to progress.`,

Dimboost, and your 1st dim's Dimension Multiplier (the number below the dimension name) should be the lowest, followed by the 2nd dim. If itâ€™s not, buy 2nd dims until it is, otherwise, continue up from 3rd to 7th dim, buying just enough dimensions to get the Dimension Multiplier higher than the last. If you have reached Dilation, you can try this strategy within that.`,
